# Incremental Design Approval

When presenting designs or plans with multiple sections:

1. **Present one section at a time** - Show only the first section initially
2. **Wait for explicit approval** - Look for confirmation like "looks good", "looks right", "yes", "approved", "continue"
3. **Proceed section-by-section** - Only show the next section after receiving approval
4. **Iterate if needed** - If user requests changes, revise that section before moving to the next

## Example Flow

```
You: [Present Section 1: Overview]
User: "Looks good"
You: [Present Section 2: Architecture]
User: "Can you change X?"
You: [Revise Section 2]
User: "Yes, that's right"
You: [Present Section 3: Implementation]
```

Do NOT present all sections at once - the user prefers reviewing and approving incrementally.
